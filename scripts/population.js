In addition, users have the ability to record their name for playback when a caller dials by name or extension.\r\nA group can have multiple Auto Attendants configured, either individually (for example, customer service with separate business hours) or integrated into a multi-level Auto Attendant (for example, enterprise’s main Auto Attendant is configured to seamlessly route to the Auto Attendant of a particular department or location).",
